● Whenever you press submit in th form, it reloads and refreshes the page. In ordeer too andle that, use onSubmit!
● State stores the value temporarily, so as long as your component is in the DOM, it will retain the value. To store the data in db, make use of redux to make a centralized db in frontend called store.
● In order to hide private info being revealed in the code files(like db url, pw), download dotenv module and make an env file.
● Redux frontend ka database hai. This pj can be made without it but it is used for complex projects with 100+ components. So instead of storing states in different components, it can be stored inside a centralised store.
